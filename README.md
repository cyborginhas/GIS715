## - [2016 US general election results](https://cyborginhas.github.io/GIS715/tableau/myStory.html)

### The goal of this Tableau story is to visualize voting data for democrats and republicans for the 2016 general election for the entire US and per county. Visualizations summarize total votes for the entire US and per county and winning party per county.

Data was sourced from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab ([2016 Election Results](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)).

## - [SLF Susceptible Crops Net Value (total and per state)](https://cyborginhas.github.io/GIS715/tableau/mydashboard2.html)

### The goal of this Tableau dashboard is to visualize the annual net value of L48 US crops that are susceptible to invasive Spotted Lanternfly (SLF).This dashboard includes a bar chart showing the annual net value of SLF susceptible crops for the entire L48 US, and a  map that displays the annual net value of SLF susceptible crops for each L48 state. The bar chart and map are linked - selecting a crop in the bar chart will update the corresponding map to display the same crop's annual net value per state.

Data sources included USDA APHIS ([Spotted Lanternfly susceptible crop list](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/spotted-lanternfly/spotted-lanternfly)) and USDA NASS ([2019 Cropland Data](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/); [2018 Crop Values Annual Summary released April 2019](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/k35694332?locale=en)).
